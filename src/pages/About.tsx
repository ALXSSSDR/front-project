      <p>
        Hello! My name is Alexander, I am 20 years old, and I am a developer and a student at Far Eastern Federal University, majoring in System Programming (Applied Mathematics and Informatics). I actively work with technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML, and CSS, as well as server-side tools like Django, DRF, Python, and PostgreSQL databases. Additionally, I am developing my skills in WordPress and Flutter. 
        Recently, I completed a program in Product Management, which has helped me gain a deeper understanding of the entire development cycle. In my free time, I enjoy sports, especially motocross and motorsports.
